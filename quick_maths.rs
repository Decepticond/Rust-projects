// I should start rust by roadman where instead of proper naming conventions like in rust by example its just British roadmen 


fn main() {
    println!("Big shaq\n");

    let result: i64 = 4+4;
    let result_2: i64 = 4+3;

    println!("Four plus four is {result}, minus one is {result_2},... quick maths.");
}
